The Backdoor Page: https://github.com/xp4xbox/Python-Backdoor/tree/master

There is only in submodule is wesng because other submodules is so wide and turning them to PDFs is toilsome.

Main Goal on this Repository:
Some people wants studying software languages just on paper. And me too wanted it.
with Almighty Allah's help i did it inshallah.
This repository includes a python backdoor program's printable* source code and for the understanding code enough libraries.
With these you just can download and print and learn them on the paper.

The Python-Basics file includes
1- library.pdf
2- tutorial.pdf
from python's official documentation webpage.

I dont think so you will need library.pdf. Because i already gived needed libraries in the libraries folder. But i think you will need tutorial.pdf.
So if you are in doubt about "am i should print this pdf". My answer would be for tutorial.pdf, yes; for library.pdf, no.

*: I mean with printable: Code fitted for paper. For example unfitted code on a paper seems like this:

A bunch of code

...

...

...

if 1 == 1:

END OF PAPER

  print("1 is 1!")


But a fitted code on a paper seems like this:


A bunch of code
...

...

...

END OF PAPER

if 1 == 1:

  print("1 is 1!")
